## Purpose

This project will contain (work is in very early stages of progress!!!) a set of Pluto notebooks that contain Julia versions of the examples in the R project `ROS-Examples` based on the book ["Regression and Other Stories" by A Gelman, J Hill and A Vehtari](https://www.cambridge.org/highereducation/books/regression-and-other-stories/DD20DD6C9057118581076E54E40C372C#overview).

These notebooks are intended to be used in conjunction with above book. Each notebook contains a chapter.

## Personal note

This project will take quite a while to complete, I expect at least a year.

But it has a special meaning to me: When I started to work on Julia interfaces for Stan's cmdstan binary in 2011, I did that to work through the ["ARM" book](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/arm/). The ["ROS" book](https://www.cambridge.org/highereducation/books/regression-and-other-stories/DD20DD6C9057118581076E54E40C372C#overview) in a sense is a successor to the ARM book.

## Prerequisites

To complete below steps and run the notebooks you need:

1. A functioning [cmdstan](https://mc-stan.org/users/interfaces/cmdstan.html).
2. A functioning [Julia](https://julialang.org/downloads/).
3. A minimal Julia base environment containing `Pkg` and `Pluto`.

## Setup the Pluto based ROSStanPluto notebooks

To (locally) use this project, do the following:

Download ROSStanPluto.jl from [RegressionAndOtherStoriesJulia](https://github.com/RegressionAndOtherStoriesJulia/), e.g. to clone it to the `~/.julia/dev/ROSStanPluto` directory:

```Julia
$ cd ~/.julia/dev # This is just my preference!
$ git clone https://github.com/RegressionAndOtherStoriesJulia/ROSStanPluto.jl ROSStanPluto
$ cd ROSStanPluto/notebooks # Move to the downloaded notebooks directory
$ julia # Start the Julia REPL
```

Still in the Julia REPL, start a Pluto notebook server.
```Julia
julia> using Pluto
julia> Pluto.run()
```

A Pluto page should open in a browser. See [this page](https://www.juliafordatascience.com/first-steps-5-pluto/) for a quick Pluto introduction.

Select the `open a file` entry box and select `chapters`. Select a chapter notebook and press `open`.
